# Soil Condition-Based Crop Prediction

## Project Overview
Measuring essential soil metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and pH value is a crucial aspect of assessing soil conditions. However, due to cost and time constraints, farmers often need to prioritize which metrics to measure. 

This project aims to assist farmers in selecting the best crop for their fields based on soil conditions by leveraging machine learning. Using the dataset `soil_measures.csv`, which contains soil measurements and the corresponding optimal crop for each field, we will build multi-class classification models to predict the best-suited crop based on soil metrics. Additionally, we will identify the most important feature for predictive performance.

## Dataset Description
The dataset `soil_measures.csv` consists of the following columns:
- `N`: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- `P`: Phosphorus content ratio in the soil
- `K`: Potassium content ratio in the soil
- `pH`: pH value of the soil
- `crop`: Categorical target variable representing the best crop for the given soil conditions

Each row represents the soil condition of a particular field, with the `crop` column indicating the optimal choice.

## Project Goals
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and outliers if necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze distributions, correlations, and patterns in soil metrics.
3. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate multi-class classification models to predict the best crop.
4. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify the most influential soil metric in predicting crop suitability.
5. **Model Deployment (Optional)**: If applicable, deploy the trained model for real-world use by farmers.
